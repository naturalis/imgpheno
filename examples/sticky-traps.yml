# This file contains the settings for the sticky-traps script.
# Here you can specify the height and the width of the traps used.
# Changing the colour of the trap requires altering the python script. I strongly reccomend 'sticking' to yellow
# It is imperative that the traps have uniform dimensions, this means that the traps cannot be cut by hand.
# The traps are also required to have no lines or text on them, unless these are on a non sticky area of the trap so it can be cropped out easily.

# This file should not be altered unless the traps used have changed.
# I strongly reccomend however to maintain the same traps during a project, as it might have an influence on the results.
# All measurements of size should be in millimetres.
# The value for the colour is specified in the HSV colour space.

# SIZES OF THE TRAPS #
######################

# The height and width of the traps should be in millimetres, with the longest of the two measurements beeing represented by the height.
trap_dimensions:
  Trap_height: 247
  Trap_width: 200

# If the trap has edges that can be cropped out, set to 'true'. otherwise, if the entire area of the trap is sticky, set to 'false'
# reasons to crop out areas are for instance non sticky areas, or small areas of text on the top and bottom of the trap.
edges_to_crop: true

# Sets the width of the area to be cropped out if the previous setting is 'true'
# both sides are cropped since the program can't discern between the top and bottom of the trap.
# If for instance the width along the short edges is set to 25 (mm), then the top 25mm and the bottom 25mm is cropped out of the rescaled image,
# so you only need to enter the width you want cropped out in millimetres in the real trap.
